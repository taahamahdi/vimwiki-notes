<pre cpp>
Vec makeVec { return {0, 0}; }
Vec v = makeVec(); // What runs here?
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
In <code>g++</code>, just a basic constructor would be called -- not a move or copy constructor

<li>
In some circumstances, C++ is allowed to (but doesn't have to) skip calling copy/move constructors

<ul>
<li>
In this example, <code>makeVec</code> writes the result directly into the space occupied by <code>v</code> in the caller, rather than creating the object in its own stack-frame and then copying it

</ul>
<li>
Another example:
<pre cpp>
void doSomething(Vec v) { // Pass-by-value calls move/copy constructor
	...
}
doSomething(makeVec()); 
// Normally calls move constructor to construct v in doSomething
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Under copy elision, the result of <code>makeVec()</code> would be written directly into the parameter of <code>doSomething</code>, saving a move

<li>
Copy elision is allowed, even if dropping the constructor call would change the behavior of the program (e.g. the constructor prints something)

<ul>
<li>
Not expected to know when copy elision occurs, are expected to know it's possible

</ul>
<li>
To build without any copy elision: <code>g++14 -fno-elide-constructors</code>, but can slow down your program considerably

<li>
In summary, we have the Rule of 5:

<ul>
<li>
If you need a custom version of any of these, you usually need a custom version of all five:

<ol>
<li>
Copy constructor

<li>
Copy assignment operator

<li>
Destructor

<li>
Move constructor

<li>
Move assignment operator

</ol>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
