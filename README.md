# Vimwiki Notes

My collection of class notes written in Vimwiki (for now, it's just CS246). Since Github does not correctly parse Vimwiki `.wiki` files, please visit [my website](http://taaha.xyz) to view my notes.

## To do
Create a script to replace all instances of `\(`, `\)` with `$` (an issue with the Vimwiki HTML parser)
