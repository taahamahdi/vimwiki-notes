# Vimwiki Notes

My collection of class notes written in Vimwiki (for now, it's just CS246). Since GitHub does not correctly parse Vimwiki `.wiki` files, please visit [my website](http://taaha.xyz) to view my notes.

You can also install the [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) plugin to view the notes locally in [Neo]vim.

## To do
Create a script to replace all instances of `\(`, `\)` with `$` (an issue with the Vimwiki HTML parser)
