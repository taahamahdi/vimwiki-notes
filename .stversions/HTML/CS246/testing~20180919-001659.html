<div id="SE Topic: Testing"><h1 id="SE Topic: Testing">SE Topic: Testing</h1></div>

<ul>
<li>
Essential part of program development

<ul>
<li>
Ongoing - begins <span id="SE Topic: Testing-before"></span><strong id="before">before</strong> you start coding

<ul>
<li>
Test suites

<li>
Expected behavior

</ul>
<li>
Continues <span id="SE Topic: Testing-while"></span><strong id="while">while</strong> you are coding

</ul>
<li>
Not the same as debugging - must test first

<li>
Cannot guarantee correctness

<ul>
<li>
Unless your program is trivial, can only prove wrongness (not possible to test every input)

</ul>
<li>
Ideally, the programmer is not the tester (not in CS246)

<li>
No general formula/guideline to follow makes it difficult

<ul>
<li>
Psychological barrier - don't want to find out your program is wrong

</ul>
</ul>
 
<ul>
<li>
Types of testing

<ul>
<li>
Human testing - humans look over code and find flaws

<ul>
<li>
Code inspections/reviews

</ul>
<li>
Machine testing - run program on selected inputs, compare with expected output

<li>
Black/white/grey box testing - no/full/some knowledge about the program implementation

<ul>
<li>
Start with black box, then supplement with white box

<ul>
<li>
Various classes of input - numeric ranges, positive vs. negative

<li>
Boundaries of valid data ranges <span id="SE Topic: Testing-(edge cases)"></span><strong id="(edge cases)">(edge cases)</strong>

<li>
Multiple simultaneous boundaries <span id="SE Topic: Testing-(corner cases)"></span><strong id="(corner cases)">(corner cases)</strong>

<li>
Intuition/experience - guess likely errors

<li>
Extreme cases (within reason)

</ul>
<li>
White box testing

<ul>
<li>
Execute all logical paths through the program

<li>
Make sure every function runs

</ul>
<li>
<span id="SE Topic: Testing-DO NOT TEST"></span><strong id="DO NOT TEST">DO NOT TEST</strong> invalid input, unless a behavior has been described

<ul>
<li>
If input is invalid, there is no corresponding correct output, so any such test case would be meaningless

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Regression testing - make sure new changes to the program don't break only test cases

<ul>
<li>
Formalize test suites with testing scripts

<ul>
<li>
Always add tests, never subtract

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
